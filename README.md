# Cambodian antagonistic soils
<div align="justify"> Here is the data and the scripts used in Barbier et al., 2025 : **"Cambodian rice field soils infested by _Meloidogyne_ spp. unveil a potential source of natural pest biocontrol agents"** </div>

<p align="justify"> **To resume :**
The aims of the study were to identify rice field soils with antagonistic effects against _Meloidogyne graminicola_ and to identfy the microbial taxa responsible for it. Then we sampled soil in 13 rice fields and we characterized their antagonistic effects against the J2 larvae of _M. graminicola_ thanks to an _in vitro_ test where the larvae are challenged with a soil suspension. We also characterized the soil physico-chemical parameters, the nematode communities and sequenced the microbiota focusing on bacteria and fungi. We identified a gradient of antagonistic activity which is lost when the soil suspensions are filtered highlighting a biotic origin. To identify organisms associated with the antagonism we used a Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (Baker and King, 2010) with the TITAN2 package and enrichment analysis with the package metacoder (Foster et al., 2016). </p>
